# mem4py - A membrane finite element solver based on kinetic dynamic relaxation

This tool provides a solution method to solve the deformations of pressurized membrane structures.
The steady-state is found with the method of kinetic dynamic relaxation which proved its effectiveness
for a variety of membrane structures.

# Installation:

mem4py is written in cython which is a C-compliable python script. In benefits from C like speedup
and can be called using a simple python script.

1. Get eigen3 either with

```
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

or download under http://eigen.tuxfamily.org.

2. Clone mem4py to folder of choice

```
git clone https://github.com/pthedens/mem4py.git
```

3. If eigen3 is not located at `/usr/include/eigen3` or `C:\Program Files\eigen3` change `EIGEN_PATH` to eigen3 in `setup.py` 
 
4. Compile in mem4py/ with

```
"python setup.py build install"
```

## Windows 
### Compiler 
Install a [cython compatible compiler (Visual Studio/Windows SDK C/C++)](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/CythonExtensionsOnWindows#using-windows-sdk-cc-compiler-works-for-all-python-versions) if you don't already have a C/C++ compiler.

### Setup environment and dependencies with Anaconda/Miniconda
```
# Assuming you are running a recent python 3.x version
conda create --name mem4py cython numpy matplotlib scipy
# Run the build script
python setup.py build install
cd tutorials && python main.py
```

# Test

In ./tutorials run `main.py` to test example cases.

# Setting up your own problem

You can set up your own problem using gmsh and a python script. In gmsh you define the geometry and boundary conditions,
and the python script is used for material and solver properties.

# Mesh:
A surface mesh in gmsh format has to be provided in the /msh folder. 

- Only 3 node triangular shells are implemented as membrane elements.

- Boundary conditions are defined on physical surfaces, lines or points 

# Material and solver properties:

In a python script the properties are defined in a `dict` which is fed to the solver. Closely follow the example
case in the tutorials folder.

mem4py extensively uses a cython version of eigen3 which is originally based on https://github.com/strohel/Ceygen.
Many thanks to the developers to make eigen3 cython compatible.
